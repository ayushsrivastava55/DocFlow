Problem Statement: Platform Documentation: Simplify platform onboarding with step-by-step guides, interactive flowcharts, and intuitive instructions. Replace lengthy traditional documentation to provide a smoother and faster learning experience for beginners.

I want to create this platform, so that a developer/user for example if he wants to study the docs of a particular concept example mongodb can go through the docs in a much more interactive manner than the standard boring docs

Step-by-Step Workflow

Step 1: User Uploads a PDF

Frontend:
Create a simple UI with a file upload button.
Use a library like React Dropzone for file uploads.
Backend:
Accept the uploaded PDF file and store it temporarily (e.g., in a folder or cloud storage like AWS S3).
Step 2: Extract Text from PDF

Use Worqhat’s Text Extraction API:
Send the PDF file to Worqhat’s API for text extraction.
Example API call:
python
Copy
def extract_text_from_pdf(file_path):
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.worqhat.com/text-extraction",
        files={"file": open(file_path, "rb")},
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
    )
    return response.json()["extracted_text"]
Step 3: Summarize the Documentation

Use Worqhat’s Text Generation API:
Summarize the extracted text into concise sections.
Example API call:
python
Copy
def summarize_text(text):
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.worqhat.com/text-generation",
        json={"prompt": f"Summarize this documentation: {text}", "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
    )
    return response.json()["summary"]
Step 4: Generate Flowcharts

Use Worqhat’s Image Generation API:
Generate flowcharts from the summarized text.
Example API call:
python
Copy
def generate_flowchart(summary):
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.worqhat.com/image-generation",
        json={"prompt": f"Create a flowchart for: {summary}", "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
    )
    return response.json()["image_url"]
Step 5: Create Interactive Tutorials

Break Documentation into Steps:
Use Worqhat’s Text Generation API to divide the documentation into step-by-step tutorials.
Example:
python
Copy
def create_tutorial(text):
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.worqhat.com/text-generation",
        json={"prompt": f"Break this documentation into step-by-step tutorials: {text}", "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
    )
    return response.json()["tutorial"]
Add Interactive Elements:
Use a frontend library like React to create interactive tutorials with:
Collapsible sections.
Quizzes or questions at the end of each section.
Embedded code editors (e.g., using CodeMirror or Monaco Editor).
Step 6: Integrated Code Editor

Embed a Code Editor:
Use CodeMirror or Monaco Editor to embed a live code editor in the platform.
Example:
jsx
Copy
import CodeMirror from '@uiw/react-codemirror';
import { javascript } from '@codemirror/lang-javascript';

function CodeEditor() {
  const [code, setCode] = useState("");

  return (
    <CodeMirror
      value={code}
      height="300px"
      extensions={[javascript()]}
      onChange={(value) => setCode(value)}
    />
  );
}
Run Code:
Use a sandbox environment like CodeSandbox or Replit to allow users to run their code directly in the platform.
Step 7: Interactive UI

Frontend Features:
Upload PDF: Allow users to upload a PDF file.
View Summaries: Display the summarized documentation.
View Flowcharts: Show generated flowcharts.
Interactive Tutorials: Provide step-by-step tutorials with quizzes and code editors.
Code Editor: Provide a live code editor for users to apply their learnings.
Example UI Layout:
Header: Platform name and logo.
Upload Section: Drag-and-drop area for PDF upload.
Content Section:
Tabs for Summary, Flowcharts, Tutorials, and Code Editor.
Code Editor Section: Live code editor with a run button.
Tech Stack

Frontend:
React.js: For building the interactive UI.
TailwindCSS: For styling.
Axios: For API calls to the backend.
Backend:
